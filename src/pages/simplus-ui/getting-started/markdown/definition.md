`weaver` is a React UI library. It allows you to develop your app based on specific components. It makes you gain time and gives you even some templates to abstract you from the boring and let you focus on the real work. Enjoy !

Before developing with `weaver`, a good knowledge of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) and [JavaScript ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) is needed.
